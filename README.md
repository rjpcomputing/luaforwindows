## Overview ##

Lua for Windows is a 'batteries included environment' for the Lua scripting language on Windows.

Lua for Windows (LfW) combines Lua binaries, Lua libraries with a Lua-capable editor in a single install package for the Microsoft Windows operating system. LfW contains everything you need to write, run and debug Lua scripts on Windows. A wide variety of libraries and examples are included that are ready to use with Microsoft Windows. LfW runs on Windows 2000 and newer versions of Windows. Lua and its associated libraries are also available for other operating systems, so most scripts will be automatically cross-platform.


## Download ##

Download Lua For Windows installer from [GitHub](http://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows/releases)

## Install Notes ##

Lua for Windows installs Lua language, SciTE based Lua IDE and Lua modules to the directory of you choice at install time. Lua for Windows and its modules all depend on the MSVC++ 2005 runtime library. Lua for Windows install will automatically download this runtime and install it for you if you don't have runtime installed on your computer. The runtime is contained in the file [vcredist\_x86.exe](http://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows/releases/download/vc-runtime/vcredist_x86.4053.exe), if you don't want this download to occur at installation then place the [vcredist\_86.exe](http://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows/releases/download/vc-runtime/vcredist_x86.4053.exe) in same directory as Lua for Windows install exe.


## LfW Components ##

Installer
Lua Interpreter,
Lua Reference Manual,
Quick Lua Tour Sample,
Examples directory,
Libraries with documentation.
Lua Compiler (luac)
Text Editors (SciTE and I think maybe wxLua editors too)
C header files/libraries/etc. for building C module
